I'd like contributors, even as this project wasn't really designed with a team in mind. I built it as research, but it has grown.

Anyone feeling ambitions can email gaztoast at gmail - put something about contributing to PCK in the subject line.

Must be decent with C#, prefer some experience working on other parsers (regardless of language)
